    "Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world [(1)](https://news.topsport.com.au/ranked-the-worlds-most-popular-sports/), [(2)](https://thesporting.blog/blog/the-most-popular-sports-in-the-world) while the most popular basketball league is definitely the National Basketball Association (NBA) [(3)](https://www.onlinebettingacademy.com/blog/2023/06/top-ten-basketball-leagues). Images below show only small part of the best NBA players that a lot of unfamiliar people probably know as well. These players have already earned (or will earn) the place in NBA Hall of Fame.\n",

    "Any basketball fan would love to attend the NBA match in real life. Unfortunately, a lot of fans (like me) live on other half of the world, which makes it difficult to attend or even watch matches online due to the different time-zones. For example, if you live in Moscow time-zone, then matches start around **1AM** and end at **7AM** (if you want to watch several games). Hence, we either have to sacrifice our sleep schedule or skip match of the favourite team. What would be even more sad if you decide to wake up early and your team loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the idea for my project arised. What if I can predict the match outcome (at least approximately) and decide if I want to sacrifice my sleep for that night. However, predicting each match would be the tedious task. Moreover, I need some data to use as foundation for predictions and since each season players switch teams, predictions would be wrong for first games. Hence, I decided to simulate only Play-Off stages. The basic steps are the following:\n",
    "1. Extract mathces results for given season with detailed statistics;\n",
    "2. Train Machine Learning (ML) model on that data;\n",
    "3. Insert teams participating in Play-Off;\n",
    "4. Simulate each Play-off round for each pair of teams eventually predicting the champion.\n",

The main datasets that we will use are `games.csv` (games information) and `teams.csv` (teams information for convenient visualization). However, I added 2 extra files with season schedule (`season_schedule.csv`) and teams participating in Play-Off for given seasons (`play_off_teams.csv`). Of course Play-off pairs generation may be automated, because there is table with team ranking but we would need to apply many filters to get useful information and handle situations if some teams have the same number of wins in season, so let us use hand-written data for now."

    "1. For each team pair we can generate small table with 7 rows of the same format that we used for training. However, teams cannot have the same percatnage of successful shots, number of assists and rebounds. Hence, we need to slightly change these numbers to add variability\n",
    "1. Predict outcome of these 7 games and identify the winner\n",
    "1. Repeat steps *4-5* for each team pair **N** number of times (101, for example, so there will not be a draw)\n",
    "1. Select team with higher number of victories to move to the next round\n",

    "1. Simulate final round as in steps *4-6* for reamining team pair\n",

On the other side there was a dinasty of **Golden State Warriors (GSW)** (73-9) with Stephen Curry (1x-NBA champion, 2x-MVP), Kevin Durant (1x-MVP) and  Klay Thompson (multiple 3PT records holder). It was clear to everyone that **GSW** would win that title again especially after 3-1 lead in the finals (they needed only 1 victory). However, everyone in Cleveland ate something (I do not know what else pushed them that much) and were able to, first, even the score in series, and, eventually, win the title. They also became the first team in NBA history (and still are) that achieved successful recovery after being down 3-1"

For example, as stated before we can take into account performance of each player individually in each game and train model on that data. Luckily, the source [Basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) provides this data as well. Hence we can add paramaters like injury or number of fouls to the model, which should potentially improve performance"
