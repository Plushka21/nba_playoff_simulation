    "Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world [(1)](https://news.topsport.com.au/ranked-the-worlds-most-popular-sports/), [(2)](https://thesporting.blog/blog/the-most-popular-sports-in-the-world) while the most popular basketball league is definitely the National Basketball Association (NBA) [(3)](https://www.onlinebettingacademy.com/blog/2023/06/top-ten-basketball-leagues). Images below show only small part of the best NBA players that a lot of unfamiliar people probably know as well. These players have already earned (or will earn) the place in NBA Hall of Fame.\n",

    "Any basketball fan would love to attend the NBA match in real life. Unfortunately, a lot of fans (like me) live on other half of the world, which makes it difficult to attend or even watch matches online due to the different time-zones. For example, if you live in Moscow time-zone, then matches start around **1AM** and end at **7AM** (if you want to watch several games). Hence, we either have to sacrifice our sleep schedule or skip match of the favourite team. What would be even more sad if you decide to wake up early and your team loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the idea for my project arised. What if I can predict the match outcome (at least approximately) and decide if I want to sacrifice my sleep for that night. However, predicting each match would be the tedious task. Moreover, I need some data to use as foundation for predictions and since each season players switch teams, predictions would be wrong for first games. Hence, I decided to simulate only Play-Off stages. The basic steps are the following:\n",
    "1. Extract mathces results for given season with detailed statistics;\n",
    "2. Train Machine Learning (ML) model on that data;\n",
    "3. Insert teams participating in Play-Off;\n",
    "4. Simulate each Play-off round for each pair of teams eventually predicting the champion.\n",

The main datasets that we will use are `games.csv` (games information) and `teams.csv` (teams information for convenient visualization). However, I added 2 extra files with season schedule (`season_schedule.csv`) and teams participating in Play-Off for given seasons (`play_off_teams.csv`). Of course Play-off pairs generation may be automated, because there is table with team ranking but we would need to apply many filters to get useful information and handle situations if some teams have the same number of wins in season, so let us use hand-written data for now."

    "We can see that only $\\leq1/3$ of winners were predicted correctly, *i.e.* 6/18 champions, while other finalists were predicted even worse. Nevertheless, if we think about it, there are many variables that can affect match outcome that we didn't consider. For example, some players may be injured and not able to play, or lead player may be disqualified from the match because of high number of fouls and *etc.* This means, that desgined model should work correctly in ideal scenario, however, there are more parameters to be taken into account. Therefore, the model can be extended, since the downloaded dataset provides the information about each of the player in each game, hence we can add paramaters like injury or numbe of fouls to the model, which should potentially improve performance"
